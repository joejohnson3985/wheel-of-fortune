# Wheel of Fortune - Game Time
FEE Mod 2 Paired Project 1

For this project we built a game show using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. We created a Wheel of Fortune game that uses different classes, inheritance from parent to child classes, works with a data set, and uses JQuery for DOM manipulation.

## Learning Goals & Emphasis
* Write a program from scratch
* Design and implement OOP patterns
* Understand and implement ES6 classes
* Implement array iterator and mutator methods to work with game data
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responibility Principle)
* Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Features
* Form for players to input their name
* Table clearly showing letter location as well as spaces and special characters
* Button to spin wheel which selects a random value as a prize or punishiment for active player
* Button for the active player to buy a vowel for a value of 100
* Button to submit a guess of the puzzle
* When you have the option to select a letter, if correctly selected, that letter will display in the table
